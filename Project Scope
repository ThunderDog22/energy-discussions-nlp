## Scope & Objectives
### Goal
To analyze Twitter discussions about energy-related concerns using sentiment analysis.

### Research Questions
What are the most common concerns people express about energy on Twitter?
Is the general sentiment toward energy-related issues positive, negative, or neutral?
Are there any spikes in concerns (e.g., due to energy crises, policy changes)?

Platform: Twitter (X)
Use the Twitter API or SNScrape to collect tweets mentioning energy-related topics.
Focus on keywords like:
"energy crisis"
"electricity prices"
"renewable energy"
"power outage"
"fuel shortage"

NLP Technique: Sentiment Analysis
Use pretrained sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, transformers like BERT for sentiment classification).
Categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral to understand public perception.

2. Set Up Your Project Environment
Create a GitHub repo and a local project folder.
Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies (e.g., numpy, pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, transformers).
Structure the project into folders (data/, scripts/, notebooks/, results/).
3. Collect Social Media Data
Use APIs to fetch real-world social media discussions.
Twitter API: Use Tweepy or SNScrape to gather tweets related to energy topics.
Reddit API: Use praw to fetch Reddit discussions about energy.
Web Scraping: Use BeautifulSoup/Selenium to scrape news articles.
Store raw data in a structured format (CSV, JSON).
4. Preprocess the Data
Clean the text (remove links, special characters, stopwords).
Tokenize and lemmatize words for NLP processing.
Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key terms like "solar energy," "power outage."
5. Perform NLP Analysis
Sentiment Analysis: Identify positive, negative, or neutral opinions.
Topic Modeling (LDA, BERTopic): Find themes in energy-related discussions.
Keyword Extraction: Extract the most frequently mentioned energy-related words.
6. Visualize & Interpret Results
Use matplotlib & seaborn to plot trends over time.
Generate word clouds for common energy-related terms.
Create bar charts of sentiment distribution.
7. Summarize Insights & Document Findings
Write a summary of key trends (e.g., rising concerns about energy prices).
Save findings in a report or Jupyter notebook.
Update the README with results and insights.
8. (Optional) Deploy & Share
Create an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit, Flask).
Host visualizations online for easy access.
Share the project on GitHub and write a blog post or documentation.
